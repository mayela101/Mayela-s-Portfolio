Hi my name is Mayela.

I'm a 2nd year Computer Science Student feel free to check out my first portfolio below!

https://mayela101.github.io/Mayela-s-Portfolio/

There are 4 text files within this repository:

It should be noted that jquery-3.6.4.min.js is a downoadable Javascript library used to facilitate and simplify HTML code.
I left it in my files for future reference but I actually linked the library through a CDN file. (index.html line 7)

It should also be noted that I used a typing text animation that I found on a sandbox site (https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/ZEJgqLN) 
The script.js file contains that code, I simply customized the text and linked the JQuery library to my index.html
